                  <h3>Chris Dovas</h3><br />
                  <p>I grew up in a very small town in New Hampshire (USA) called Goffstown. I started playing drums when I was 5 years old. My first big drumming inspiration was Tommy Aldridge. I wanted to play like him because of the way he made me feel when he played his YAMAHA Recording Customs. As I got older and have grown as a musician, my list of drumming heroes has grown and have helped me understand what music is about and what I want to sound like when I’m playing or writing. A huge part of my development as a musician was developing my groove/pocket and my time. Learning how to relate my fills to my groove was a turning point in my education, I thank Dave DiCenso for that. Also learning many different genres of music as possible has helped me take the influences from other styles and create a unique sound of my own. Now I am able to play a brush ballad with just as much feel and touch as double bass at over 200 beats per minute. My playing has matured overtime. I appreciate all styles of music. My goal when I’m behind a drum set is to put my heart and soul into the music and make others feel just as good as I do when they hear my playing. I play every note as if it were my last.</p>
                  <p> Chris Dovas is a young New Hampshire based studio and touring drummer that is competent in a vast range of musical genres and styles. Chris Dovas, influenced by many genres of music, is a very technical and emotional player. Chris has enough energy to power various audiences as his playing is ignited by his soulful touch of the instrument, his passion, and performance.Chris is currently an active member of Seven Spires, Aversed, Mike Kerr Group, The Robert Blackhorse Project, and EBC Jazz Trio. In addition, he is currently recording for Widows Rite's debut record and is successfully developing his personal YouTube project. Chris is also the winner of the 2015 Blue Man Group Drum Competition. Participating in a number of projects allows Chris to showcase his technical skills in various genres of music. The blend of music styles that Chris performs (Metal, Fusion, Rock, Pop, Gospel, Jazz, Funk, R&B, Latin, and Blues) also allowed him to develop his own unique sound, feel, and playing style that has been acknowledged by fellow musicians and fans. Listening to “now” and “then”, Chris Dovas’ playing uncovers the rapid growth of maturity in a musician's persona.Since hitting the drums for the first time at age five, Chris has constantly expanded his musical horizons. He has been fortunate to share the stage with many bands, some of which include: Apocalyptica, Black Veil Brides, Sonata Arctica, The Agonist, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Amaranthe, and many more. His hard work, determination, and passion were featured in the NH Chronicle TV Show, The Union Leader, and some online interviews/reviews from sites such as, deadrhetoric.com, musicmanager33.blogspot.com,  https://www.blueman.com/BostonDrumOff, http://northeastrockreview.com/ and http://www.berklee-blogs.com, to name a few.Armed with the drum kit and drumsticks, Chris Dovas goes through his performances with a constant passion and emotion that allows him to create close bonds with a developing fan base that is spreading across the country. He drives the audiences to a sweat-crazed experience where both, the audience and Chris himself, can feel at home.</p>

                  <h3>ADRIENNE COWAN</h3><br />
                  <p>Adrienne Cowan is a Berklee-trained, composer, and orchestrator. Equal parts eccentric Jack Sparrow and poignant nostalgia, she touches heavily on escapism as well as expressing a distantly romantic outlook on death, solo voyages, love, and hope. </p>
                  <p> Her musical training has been both extensive and intense. It began at the age of 6 when she commenced her journey as a classically trained pianist, after two years of delightedly poking at the keys. She later won the 2013 Lollapalooza-endowed scholarship to attend Berklee College of Music, where she studied opera singing, lyric writing and songwriting, and composition. She learned to conduct, compose, and arrange for ensembles ranging from string quartets to full orchestra, and earned the Vocal Department Achievement Award, in recognition of outstanding musicianship. Vocally, she cites her time grinding through rock and metal scenes as a self-taught metal vocalist as the most influential ingredient in her signature pallet of Halford-esque screams, low growls, and powerful melodic passages. However, in addition to her operatic training, she has also studied Speech Level Singing at the Academy of Contemporary Music in Surrey, UK, and classical singing with various teachers around the world throughout her middle and high school career. </p>
                  <div class="description">
                    <blockquote> Outside of her education, she thrives on collaboration. She has sung with Swedish metal band Amaranthe, and writes and co-writes lyrics, toplines, and full songs with other artists including fellow Berklee alum Erik Huang ("Akshara" 2016). She is pleased to be a mixing/mastering client of Sascha Paeth of Avantasia, and is the vocalist for several other metal bands including Seven Spires (USA) and Light & Shade (IT).</blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <p>In her very little spare time, Adrienne enjoys Sagan’s contemplations of man’s place in the universe, seeing the world, getting lost in jRPGs, and drinking copious amounts of coffee.</p>
